### **Evaluating RAG Performance: DeepSeek R1 vs. GPT-4o vs. Claude 3.5 Sonnet**  

With the rapid evolution of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** applications, evaluating large language models (LLMs) with robust, standardized metrics is more critical than ever. This article presents a **comprehensive benchmark comparison** of the newly released **DeepSeek R1** against two leading GenAI models—**Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and **OpenAI GPT-4o**.  

To ensure an objective assessment, we employ the **LLM-as-a-Judge** approach, leveraging **`mlflow.metrics.genai.metric_definitions`**, a core component of **MLflow's GenAI evaluation framework**. This framework provides predefined metrics to quantify various aspects of model performance, from accuracy and verbosity to readability and bias detection.  

### **Key Evaluation Metrics**  

- **Token Count** – Tracks the number of tokens generated in a response, essential for **cost estimation** (e.g., API usage) and **controlling verbosity**.  
- **Answer Correctness** – Measures factual accuracy by comparing model responses against reference answers, often using **embedding similarity, LLM-based grading, or human evaluation**.  
- **Toxicity** – Detects **harmful, offensive, or biased content**, typically assessed using classifiers or tools like **Perspective API**.  
- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level** – Evaluates **text readability** based on sentence structure and word complexity. Lower scores indicate easier-to-read text (e.g., an 8th-grade level is accessible to middle school readers).  
- **Automated Readability Index (ARI) Grade Level** – Another readability measure that considers **character count per word** and **words per sentence**, where **higher ARI values indicate increased complexity** (e.g., ARI 12+ = college-level text).
